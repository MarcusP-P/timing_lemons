# üçã Lemons Timing

This project was created after https://timing.71wytham.org.uk/ was forced to take his amazing live timing screen offline. 
You can load this with any JSON feed that fits the format üòâüòâ, if you look around the LEMONS site you can find it. 
Mind you, you might need a bit of technological knowledge to get it running. You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/marthyn) for help, send it through DM or email me at info@voxapex.nl

Create a .env file in the root of the project with `FEED_URL=someurl.json` or replace it in the [TimingsController](app/controllers/timings_controller.rb) file. 

To run the project make sure you can run any Ruby on Rails project https://gorails.com/setup

After installing everything you need you should be able to run rails server and go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your browser

Follow all the action at [RadioLemans](http://radiolemans.co)! Follow [RadioLemans](https://twitter.com/radiolemans) on twitter as well.
